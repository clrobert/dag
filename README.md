Issues:
- Adding a node through the CLI does not show up upon further iteration.
- Adding a node after deleting a node, and then listing nodes results in memory error.
- Usability does not do a deep traversal. Requirement: If a resource's dependency is unusable, that resource is now unusable.
- It may be preferable to use a _list_ instead of a _vector_ as a primary data structure.

Next:
- Use smart pointers where appropriate.
- Pass references instead of huge containers.
